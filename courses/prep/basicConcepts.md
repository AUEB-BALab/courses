## Basic Concepts
* Software
* Computer program
* Algorithm
* System software vs. Application software
* Compiler and Interpeter
* Software architecture
* Full-stack application development


## Software
* Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions
* Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own
* A collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as software


## Computer program
* A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer
* A computer executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit
* A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language
* From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine code
* Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter


## Algorithm
* A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm 
* An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed
* Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks

## Application software
* App or application for short
* A computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user
* Examples: a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser etc.
* The collective noun "application software" refers to all applications collectively (contrasts with system software)
* Apps built for mobile platforms are called mobile apps


## Software architecture
* Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system
* Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations
* The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building


## Full-stack application development
* Refers to software development covering all the layers of a 3-tier architecture:
