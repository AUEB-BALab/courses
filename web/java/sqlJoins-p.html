## SQL Joins


## SELEECT Statement
* A business needs to organize its information
* Database solution
![](media/statement.png)


## WHERE Clause
* The WHERE clause is used to filter records

SQL WHERE Syntax
```
SELECT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
```


## WHERE Clause
Example
```
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```


## GROUP BY Statement
* Is used in conjunction with the aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, etc.) to group the result-set by one or more columns

SQL GROUP BY Syntax
```
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value
GROUP BY column_name;
```


## GROUP BY Statement
Example
```
SELECT customer_id, count(*) 
FROM Customers 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```


## SQL Join
* Joining data together is one of the most significant strengths of a relational database
* An SQL join is a Structured Query Language (SQL) instruction to combine data from two sets of data (e.g. two tables) as long as they are relations
* Tables are “joined” two at a time making a new relation (a table generated on the fly) containing all possible combinations of rows from the original two tables

## Inner Joining 3 tables
```
SELECT *
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Grade
	ON Student.ID = Grade.ID
INNER JOIN Course
	ON Grade.Code = Course.Code;
```

## Exercise 14
* Give an interesting query of your own that is not already in the assignment. The query should involve an aggregation operation, and a nested SELECT. 


## From Class Diagram to ER
* Construct a Class Diagram
  * The University of Toronto has several departments. Each department has professors. Professors must be assigned to one, but possibly more departments. At least one professor teaches each course, but a professor may be on sabbatical and not teach any course. Each course may be taught by one professor. We know of the department name, the professor name, the professor id, the course names, the course schedule, the term/year that the course is taught, the departments the professor is assigned to, the department that offers the course. 


## From Class Diagram to ER
Identify Classes & Associations
These are the abstract or physical “things” in our system which we wish to describe. Find all the nouns and noun phrases in the domain descriptions you have obtained through your analysis. Consider these class candidates. The class candidates are departments, professor, course, and course section.
